# Binaural Beat Generator Streamlit App - Plan

**1. Project Setup and File Structure:**

*   Create a new directory for the Streamlit application.
*   Create the main application file (`app.py`).
*   Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.

**2. Core Functionality Implementation:**

*   Implement the binaural beat generation logic using a suitable audio processing library (e.g., NumPy and SciPy).
*   Define functions to generate audio data for each brainwave state (Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta) based on pre-defined frequency ranges.

**3. Streamlit UI Development:**

*   Design a user-friendly interface using Streamlit components.
*   Include a selectbox for users to choose their desired brainwave state.
*   Add a slider for volume adjustment.
*   Implement real-time audio playback using Streamlit's audio component.

**4. Dependency Management:**

*   Specify the necessary Python packages in the `requirements.txt` file (e.g., streamlit, numpy, scipy).

**5. Testing and Refinement:**

*   Test the application thoroughly to ensure accurate binaural beat generation and smooth audio playback.
*   Refine the UI based on user feedback and usability considerations.

**6. Documentation:**

*   Add comments to the code to explain the functionality.
